1
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:34,344
Get out of my way!

2
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:37,222
Bastard!

3
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:39,224
Wait, bastard!

4
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:45,730
Help!
A guy with knife is chasing me.

5
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:46,439
Get out of my way!

6
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,066
Lower the knife!

7
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:48,942
I'll kill you!

8
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:49,818
Lower the knife!

9
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:50,944
He's a pervert!

10
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,529
I can explain.

11
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,697
I'm a reporter from the Meicho.

12
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,659
Then why were you asking
my wife

13
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:59,160
about her panties?

14
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:55,592
Excuse me,

15
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,137
I'd like to make an appointment
to see your listing in Shibuya.

16
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,181
Miss, acquiring
property in Tokyo

17
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,225
is a very complicated endeavor.

18
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,436
Yes, I'm aware of that.

19
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,146
Could we set an appointment
for tomorrow?

20
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:12,901
I'm afraid there are many
steps that must be taken.

21
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:15,737
I've taken those steps.
I'd like to see the space.

22
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:20,199
I'm afraid
the owner of that space

23
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:23,870
wouldn't be interested
in renting to you.

24
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:25,997
I see...

25
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,875
Then I'll find someone who is.

26
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,668
Thank you for your time.

27
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:31,182
Panty thief?

28
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:06,592
Thank you.

29
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:30,950
Rewrite it.

30
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,076
Yes. Will do.

31
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:52,597
Rewrite it.

32
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:03,441
No good.

33
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:28,591
Alright, you worthless
piece of shit.

34
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,346
Let's try this again.

35
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:39,352
You're crossing the street,
minding your own business,

36
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:43,731
when this jogger comes out of
nowhere and slams into you...

37
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:47,735
And?

38
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:48,903
What then?

39
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:51,656
What do you want me to say?

40
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,452
The truth. In your words.

41
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,380
The victim had an accidental
run-in with a thug.

42
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:08,881
Wrong place, wrong time.

43
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,384
Funaki, you don't really
believe that.

44
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,845
We have his prints on the
knife and a signed deposition.

45
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,847
What more do you want?

46
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,017
A low level Tozawa goon
just walks in off the street

47
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,018
and gives himself up?

48
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,312
Feels like the fastest way
to kill an investigation.

49
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:24,480
Investigation?

50
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:28,526
Our job is to clear cases.

51
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,279
This is going in.

52
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,203
That's the third shop
in the last month.

53
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,580
All under our protection.

54
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:44,709
Tozawa.

55
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:49,547
He's trying to prove
we can't protect our territory.

56
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:52,425
We have to hit back.

57
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,929
And risk war?

58
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,890
But this is war.

59
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,143
We hit back,

60
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,729
Chikara-kai will be seen
as the instigators,

61
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,732
and the cops
will come down on us.

62
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,234
Are you idiots?!

63
00:10:12,611 --> 00:10:15,573
No. No retaliation.

64
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:20,369
For now, we increase
protection fees.

65
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,833
We use the extra money
to close ranks and prepare.

66
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,211
Kume,

67
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:31,339
Kobayashi...

68
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:36,010
if a war is coming
with Tozawa, we'll be ready.

69
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,853
Oyabun likes them
chopped fine.

70
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:50,191
Tip stays on the board,
one smooth motion...

71
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,777
Damn, Sato.

72
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,196
You think

73
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,449
maybe you went
into the wrong business?

74
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,953
Hope you're as good with that
knife outside the kitchen.

75
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:07,708
Should we go find out?

76
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,260
Go make the rounds.

77
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,471
They've already paid
this month.

78
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,057
Now they're paying more.

79
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,309
Okay.

80
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:35,486
Don't fuck up the onions.

81
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,175
Considering the evidence,

82
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,844
and now this confession,
we expect an easy conviction.

83
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:09,807
I hope this will bring
you and your family

84
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,183
some measure of comfort.

85
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:25,364
Forgive me if this is
too painful to revisit but...

86
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:27,116
I understand,

87
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,577
from the statement
you gave Detective Funaki

88
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,995
that your husband
was having financial problems.

89
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:35,165
I went through all this
with the other detectives.

90
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,210
They didn't seem
to think it was relevant.

91
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:39,920
Of course.

92
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:46,176
I'm just following up to ensure
nothing's been overlooked.

93
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:52,433
We borrowed.

94
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:54,560
Too much.

95
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,813
We missed one payment

96
00:14:57,896 --> 00:15:00,190
and the interest rate
became ten times higher.

97
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,527
So my husband pushed back.

98
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:04,945
How so?

99
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:09,241
He was gathering information
to bring to a lawyer.

100
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,494
About these lenders
and their...

101
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,121
methods.

102
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:19,001
Do you happen to have
that information?

103
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,467
Yes.

104
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:44,943
May I help you?

105
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:49,406
My name is Jake Adelstein.
I'm with the Meicho Shimbun.

106
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:53,911
I'm sorry, I've been asked
not to speak with the press.

107
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,120
Really?

108
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:56,455
But...

109
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,084
just a few minutes is enough.

110
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,378
May I have some of your time?

111
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,545
I'm afraid I have company...

112
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:14,556
Takahiro Aoki has borrowed
a large amount of money.

113
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,059
How do you feel
about a dirtbag like him

114
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,686
living in your neighborhood?

115
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:32,324
Well, then,
can I ask you one--

116
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,992
I have nothing to share.

117
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:40,040
I will come again.

118
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,378
I'm sorry for bothering you.

119
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,298
Once again,
my deepest condolences.

120
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,692
Hey, he looks like
real yakuza, right?

121
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:52,529
Wanna play?

122
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,540
He's gonna kill this.

123
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,702
With my humble regards.

124
00:19:56,987 --> 00:20:00,032
Malee, hurry up.
I don't have much time today--

125
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,876
Go home, Samantha.

126
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:44,803
Those things stink.

127
00:21:45,303 --> 00:21:46,763
They're French.

128
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,904
I see that.

129
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:20,505
A trendy actor, yeah?

130
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:23,425
You got nice hair,
like an actor's.

131
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:26,678
Gaijin!

132
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,311
Read this. Out loud. Now.

133
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:35,187
Yes.

134
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:38,315
Underwear thief...captured...

135
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:47,574
Today at 12:30 p.m.,

136
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:50,869
the Shinjuku police arrested an
office worker, age forty-one,

137
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:53,705
a resident of Shinjuku-ward
Kabuki-cho Block 1,

138
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,290
on charges of theft.

139
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:58,752
The police raided his apartment
and found

140
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:06,885
400 pairs of women's underwear,
color-coded and sorted.

141
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,974
But according to you,
there is no underwear thief.

142
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:21,691
We can't trust you
to report one simple story.

143
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:31,827
That's why you're shit.

144
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:34,246
Go to scrapbooking.

145
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:35,080
You're done here.

146
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,220
Last time I checked,
Katagiri,

147
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:53,056
loan sharks don't kill people,

148
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:57,727
because dead men pay no debts.

149
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,604
You don't find it suspicious?

150
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:03,733
That just before filing
a lawsuit against the lender,

151
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:06,194
the man is murdered
by a low-level yakuza?

152
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:10,615
We've been
down this road before.

153
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:12,826
Or don't you remember?

154
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:15,829
Ohara-san, this is different.

155
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:16,997
Sure.

156
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:18,623
The difference is this case

157
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,417
has a deposition,
a murder weapon,

158
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:23,253
and a violent criminal
behind bars.

159
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:24,671
It's closed.

160
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:44,816
Thanks.

161
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:51,907
Racist nationalist.

162
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:55,952
You've got those too, right?

163
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:08,757
Move.

164
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,674
Sorry.

165
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:11,129
(in Korean) Yeah.
You heard me. I said shut up.

166
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:14,591
(in Korean) What part of that
don't you understand?

167
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:17,969
(in Korean)
Shut the fuck up! Right now!

168
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:21,389
(in Korean) No...no...don't
you...don't you look at me!

169
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:28,396
(in Korean) Did you hear me!
Don't you fucking look at me!

170
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,248
Check out Yuta!

171
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,420
Looks like he needs
to take a dump!

172
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,507
Fuck you. Fuck all of you.

173
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:03,051
I'm back.

174
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:08,973
Please check these.

175
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:17,815
Who's short?

176
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:22,779
Duke.
Said he'd have it next month.

177
00:30:26,824 --> 00:30:28,368
All that money going through
the club every night,

178
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:30,078
he can't cough up
an extra hundred thousand?

179
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,334
You're sure he didn't offer you
house credit in the meantime?

180
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:39,295
Some shit about how,
"You could have

181
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:40,672
a good time here
with the girl of your choice?"

182
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:48,555
What the fuck
are you looking at?

183
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:49,806
Sorry.

184
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,143
Don't ever lie to me again.

185
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,516
If I don't get a real story
as soon as possible,

186
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,559
I'm gonna get fired.

187
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:38,998
What's that supposed to mean?

188
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:38,850
So good.

189
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:43,646
Excuse me.

190
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,314
Coming.

191
00:33:47,024 --> 00:33:47,608
Yes?

192
00:33:48,025 --> 00:33:49,652
Another of everything.

193
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:54,031
And an extra serving
of short ribs.

194
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:56,117
Extra serving.

195
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:58,244
Delicious, eh?

196
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:12,759
Excuse me.

197
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:14,427
You're leaving?

198
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:28,024
We're busy today, huh?

199
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:34,572
Cute tie!

200
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,340
Hurry up, will you?

201
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:53,299
Sorry.

202
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:02,809
Hey!

203
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:05,978
What the fuck
are you sitting down for?

204
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:07,396
Table 7.

205
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,272
Go!

206
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,375
Where's my Imperial Brut?

207
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:28,793
I've been waiting a while.

208
00:35:29,126 --> 00:35:29,836
One moment.

209
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:10,543
Excuse me, here's the check.

210
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:28,352
Let's raise our glasses.

211
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:34,817
Excuse me. Samantha,
you are being requested.

212
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:37,820
All right.
If you'll excuse me...

213
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:42,950
I'm very sorry.
Here's Nana instead.

214
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:25,636
That blonde girl, Samantha.

215
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,930
Sure. This way.

216
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:41,527
She will be right with you.

217
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,320
Excuse me.

218
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:48,117
You have a customer.
You know what to do.

219
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:06,844
You came alone this time.

220
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:14,477
Gives us a chance to chat.

221
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:18,773
Finally.

222
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:47,218
You're a glutton
for punishment, aren't you?

223
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:03,359
Tattoo...

224
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:05,736
Cool kicks.

225
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:51,365
Excuse me...

226
00:40:52,449 --> 00:40:53,200
Hey!

227
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:18,809
From America.

228
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:31,906
Counterfeit.

229
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:37,745
Really?

230
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,355
This is today's last train.

231
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:50,567
This is today's last train.
Please hurry.

232
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:54,697
This is today's last train.
Please hurry.

233
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:09,373
Hang in there.

234
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:20,397
Who's that?

235
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:23,609
No one.

236
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,933
This is an urgent announcement
from the Police Department.

237
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:58,560

00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:43,730
Shut the fuck up!

00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:50,070
Try me if you got the balls.

246
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,239
I'll fucking shoot you!

247
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:53,865
- Nakamura, put the gun down!
- Don't, Nakamura.

248
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:56,368
Wait.

249
00:49:58,286 --> 00:49:59,621
We--we can talk about it.

250
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:01,623
Please, let me explain.

251
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:05,460
This is who you pay
to protect you?

252
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:09,005
These Chihara-kai punks

253
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:11,341
can't protect shit!

254
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:13,927
Listen.

255
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:18,348
We go where we want,
we drink where we want!

256
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:21,059
This district, this city...

257
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:23,729
belongs to Tozawa now.

258
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:27,441
You tell Ishida that.

259
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,485
Just shoot him.

260
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:35,991
Fuck it.

261
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:41,580
Nakamura!

262
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:09,649
Nice watch.

263

Thanks.

From Hong Kong.

265
00:51:18,074 --> 00:51:19,409
Looks as good as a real one.

266
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:16,550
Hey.

267
00:52:27,602 --> 00:52:29,354
Meicho reporter...I see.

268
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:33,692
Your camera.

269
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:56,882
You hear me?
